- Bug Report Interface
- Upgrade the dependency to GTK+ 3.4 when it is available on Debian Wheezy
- Import playlist data from legacy version
- Auto-save the changes in the playlist (to another file), if the player is
  not terminated normally, users can choose whether to use the auto-saved one.
- Solve the library path name problem (in Fedora x64, it will be $PREFIX/lib64,
  in Debian Testing/sid x64, it will be $PREFIX/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu)

Long-term:
- GObject Introspection (GI) support
- Command Line Interface (CLI), based on ncurses
- Mini mode (plug-in? based on Clutter?)
- More plug-ins
- More spectrum style
- Non-Unix platform support
- Music Library
- More interfaces in MPRIS v2.1 support
- Multi-touch support

Other ideas:
- Better karaoke mode plug-in?
- Perl plug-in loader?
- Vala support
