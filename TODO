- Language translations (remaining: Japanese)
- Bug Report Interface

Long-term:
- Command Line Interface (CLI), based on ncurses
- Mini mode (plug-in? based on Clutter?)
- More plug-ins
- More spectrum style
- Non-Unix platform support
- Music Library
- More interfaces in MPRIS v2.1 support
- Multi-touch support

Other ideas:
- Better karaoke mode plug-in?
- Perl plug-in loader?
- Vala support

* Add an option that the embeded theme can be disabled.
* Move the two list views to new classes, and make a new class
  for the main window.
