- Bug Report Interface
- Sort the playlist
- New information and control pad
- Move the playlist functions from db module into a new playlist module.

Long-term:
- Command Line Interface (CLI), based on ncurses
- Mini mode (plug-in?)
- More plug-ins
- Non-Unix platform support
- Music Library
- More interfaces in MPRIS v2.1 support
- Multi-touch support
- Move to GStreamer 1.0 if it is available in Debian Wheezy (or later
  release version)
- New icon and default cover image.

Other ideas:
