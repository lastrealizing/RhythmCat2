- Bug Report Interface
- Sort the playlist
- Optimize spectrum show.

Long-term:
- Command Line Interface (CLI), based on ncurses
- Mini mode (plug-in? based on Clutter?)
- More plug-ins
- More spectrum style
- Non-Unix platform support
- Music Library
- More interfaces in MPRIS v2.1 support
- Multi-touch support
- Move to GStreamer 1.0 if it is available in Debian Wheezy (or later
  release version)

Other ideas:
- Better karaoke mode plug-in?
- Vala support
