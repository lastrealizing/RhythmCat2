- Bug Report Interface
- Sort the playlist
- New information and control pad
- Music Library Interface (in LibRhythmCat)
- Player Command Interpreter build in LibRhythmCat
- Switchable audio sink
- Use desktop.in

Long-term:
- Command Line Interface (CLI), based on ncurses
- Mini mode (plug-in?)
- More plug-ins
- Non-Unix platform support
- Music Library
- More interfaces in MPRIS v2.1 support
- Multi-touch support
- Move to GStreamer 1.0 if it is available in Debian Wheezy (or later
  release version)
- New icon and default cover image.
- Make a GTK+ 2 port for legacy systems (Will be RhythmCat 1.4.x).

Other ideas:
- Better karaoke mode plug-in?
- Vala support
