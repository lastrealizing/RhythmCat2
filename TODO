- Language translations (remaining: Japanese)
- Bug Report Interface
- Upgrade the dependency to GTK+ 3.4 when it is available on Debian Wheezy

Long-term:
- Command Line Interface (CLI), based on ncurses
- Mini mode (plug-in? based on Clutter?)
- More plug-ins
- More spectrum style
- Non-Unix platform support
- Music Library
- More interfaces in MPRIS v2.1 support
- Multi-touch support

Other ideas:
- Better karaoke mode plug-in?
- Perl plug-in loader?
- Vala support
