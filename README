Introduction:

RhythmCat2 is a music player which can be used under Linux. It is not only a
normal music player, it has both command-line interface and graphic user
interface, and it can extend its features by plug-ins, like lyric show
in window, desktop lyric show, etc... The GTK+ UI can use custom GTK+ 3 themes,
and the UI layout can be changed partially.

Since this project in just in experimental stage, only GTK+ UI frontend has been
implemented.
