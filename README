Introduction:

RhythmCat2 is a music player which can be used under Linux. It is not only a
normal music player, it has both command-line interface and graphic user
interface, and it can extend its features by plug-ins, like lyric show
in window, desktop lyric show, etc... The GTK+ UI can use custom GTK+ 3
themes, and the UI layout can be customed partially.

Since this project in just in experimental stage, only GTK+ UI frontend has
been implemented.

Developing platform:

Operating System: Debian Wheezy (Testing) for AMD64
Compiler: gcc 4.6.3
Programming Language: C
Dependent Libraries (Minimum Runtime Requirement): glib-2.0 (>=2.32)
    gtk+-3.0(>=3.4) gtk-doc-tools(>=1.18) gstreamer-0.10 (>=0.10.31)
    gstreamer-plugins-base-0.10 (>=0.10.31)
    gstreamer-plugins-good-0.10 (>=0.10.31)
    
Suggest Libraries: gstreamer-plugins-bad-0.10 gstreamer-plugins-ugly-0.10

It is possible to support plug-in written in Python3 if installed Python3
development packages and enabled Python3 plug-in support argument in configure.

Developing stage:

Unstable, features are implemented basically, somehow not well tested.

How to install this program:

Get the latest version from Github:

git clone git://github.com/supercatexpert/RhythmCat2.git

Now only source code is available, you should compile it, then you can
use this program. Before you compile it, you should check the
developing environment, and the libraries which this program depends. On
Debian/Ubuntu, you can run the commands below to help you install the packages
that the compilation needed: 

sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool libgtk-3-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev \
    libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev gtk-doc-tools

If you want to compile Python3 loader and use Python3 plug-ins, install
package python3-dev (need Python version 3.2 or above):

sudo apt-get install python3-dev

If you want to play MP3 or other Restricted Audio Format, please install
GStreamer Bad & Ugly plug-ins. In Debian/Ubuntu, you can just run:

sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly

Then you can try to compile it:

./configure --with-native-plugins --with-python3-plugins
make
sudo make install

Notice: You can remove argument '--with-native-plugins' or
'--with-python3-plugins' if you do not need native plug-ins or
Python3 plug-ins.

then just run /usr/local/bin/RhythmCat2, feel happy with it!

This program is in experimental stage now. We provide absolute no WARRANTY.
