{"name":"RhythmCat2","body":"## Introduction:\r\n\r\nRhythmCat2 the next gernation of RhythmCat Music Player. It is a music player which can be used under Linux. It is not only a normal music player, it has both command-line interface (to be implemented) and graphic user interface, and it can extend its features by plug-ins, like lyric show in window, desktop lyric show, etc... The GTK+ UI can use custom GTK+ 3 themes, and the UI layout can be changed partially.\r\n\r\nSince this project in just in experimental stage, only GTK+ UI frontend has been implemented.\r\n\r\n## Developing platform:\r\n\r\nOperating System: Debian Wheezy (Testing) for AMD64\r\n\r\nCompiler: gcc 4.6.3\r\n\r\nProgramming Language: C\r\n\r\nDependent Libraries: glib-2.0 (>=2.32) gtk+-3.0(>=3.2) libjson0 (>=0.9) gstreamer-0.10 (>=0.10.30) gstreamer-plugins-base-0.10 (>=0.10.30) gstreamer-plugins-good-0.10 (>=0.10.30)\r\n\r\nSuggest Libraries (Optional): gstreamer-plugins-bad-0.10 gstreamer-plugins-ugly-0.10 libcurl (>=7.0) python3 (>=3.2) python3-dev (>=3.2)\r\n\r\n## Developing stage:\r\nUnstable, features are implemented basically, somehow not well tested.\r\n\r\n## License:\r\nGNU GPL v3.\r\n\r\nYou MUST accept the GPL v3 License, then you can use this program and the\r\nsource code.\r\n\r\nYou can get the GPL v3 License (plain text) here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt\r\n\r\nOr read the COPYING file in the source archive.\r\n\r\n## How to install this program:\r\nGet the latest version from Github:\r\n\r\n`git clone git://github.com/supercatexpert/RhythmCat2.git`\r\n\r\nNow only source code is available, you should compile it, then you can use this program. Before you compile it, you should check the developing environment, and the libraries which this program depends. On Debian/Ubuntu, you can run the commands below to help you install the packages that the compilation needed: \r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk-3-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev \\\r\n    libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev libjson0-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev`\r\n\r\nIf you want to compile Python3 loader and use Python3 plug-ins, install\r\npackage python3-dev:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install python3-dev`\r\n\r\nIf you want to play MP3 or other Restricted Format, please install Gstreamer\r\nBad & Ugly plugins. In Debian/Ubuntu, you can just run:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly`\r\n\r\nThen you can try to compile it:\r\n\r\n`./configure --with-native-plugins --with-python3-plugins`\r\n\r\n`make`\r\n\r\n`sudo make install`\r\n\r\nPS: You can remove --with-native-plugins or --with-python3-plugins arguments if you do not need native plug-ins or Python3 plug-ins.\r\n\r\nthen just run /usr/local/bin/RhythmCat2, feel happy with it!\r\n\r\nThis program is in experimental stage now. We provide no WARRANTY. \r\nIf you found any bugs, please send an e-mail to me, and report the bugs you\r\nfound. My e-mail: supercatexpert@gmail.com . Or send the Issue on the \r\nGithub project page.\r\n","tagline":"The next generation of RhythmCat Music Player.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
